This is a d3.js chord diagram visualization of the systems that comprise the Business Enterprise Architecture (version 10.0).  It displays the number of interfaces between these systems.
 
Background:
The Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer annually delivers the BEA for the Department of Defense Business Mission Area to help defense business system owners and program managers make informed decisions. BEA 10.0 was officially delivered February 14, 2013.

Description:
The SV-6 (Systems Resource Flow Matrix) is one of many system views that comprise the BEA.  It shows the information exchanges (IEs) between automated BEA systems.  The visualization below represents the matrix as a chord diagram. The BEA systems are aggregated based on System Node (Core Business Mission). These eight System Nodes, represented as arcs, are positioned along the circumference of a circle. The IEs between System Nodes are represented as quadratic Bézier curves. IE directionality is represented by arc color. The size of the curve indicates the volume of IEs. Hover over a curve to see the number of IEs between System Nodes.
